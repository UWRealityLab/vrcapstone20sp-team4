                <p>An augmented reality cooking app that guides users through step-by-step instructions in Magic Leap. We believe this application can provide users with an intuitive and enjoyable culinary experience.</p>
                <p>Cooking is supposed to be a fun process. However, many people struggle with constantly switching between stovetops and digital recipes  when learning to cook something new. The hassle can be inconvenient and unsanitary. An Augmented Reality display is a perfect solution to this dilemma as users can refer to a recipe while keeping the food tractable at the same time. Previous projects in AR cooking are concepts of showing a 2D screen of recipe and instructions overlayed on top of the 3D environment, but none of them has fully taken advantage of ML’s support on spatial mapping and image tracking. The 2D interfaces are not as entertaining to interact with either. Also, some of them do have good user interaction but are hardcoded and only works in a specific scene. With Magic Leap, we believe we can create an application that users can easily use in their kitchen without complicated setup, and that provides consistent information on time and location of food. We are also planning on creating human-centered UI and delightful animation to make the cooking experience interactive and amusing.</p>

                <p class="sub-heading mb-5">Weekly Blog Posts</p>  
                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week consisted of us getting acquainted with each other as well as figuring out how to set Unity and the tutorials that we walked through. We also worked on brainstorming ideas for our projects. We have come up with the very basic idea that we want to help people communicate with each other during this time, however a deeper dive into actual ideas is needed. Each member of the group does similar work this week.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>Get a stronger idea for what we want to make. We will be meeting up and having more brainstorming sessions for getting a more solid idea down. Our goal is to get the website up and running by next week as well as finalize the initial design of our application. In addition, we also want to do some research about networking and creating a multiplayer game using Unity’s frameworks.</p>


                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week we tried to come up with ideas for our project. We want our experience to enable people to come together during these times. When brainstorming ideas, we were drawn to making an intimate experience for close friends or those in relationships. However there were a couple of issues with this, including making an intimate experience in VR as well as the fact that many of our ideas are already done outside of VR. During our lab time and presentation of our ideas with the staff, we decided that there were too many experiences that let people interact with one another, and so we switched our idea to a cooking AR project.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>We will iterate on our cooking idea, and will put together a pitch video for Tuesday as well as start to narrow our ideas down to fill out the PRD. Everyone will be working on this to get a solid idea down.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week consisted of finalizing our idea for our project. Coming off of the initial project idea meeting from 4/9, we decided that we wanted to move in a different direction from a shared VR experience to making an AR app to help with cooking. For the duration of this week, we came up with more concrete ideas for these topics, and figured out specific deliverables. These meetings and working on the PRD consisted of all group members pitching their ideas and figuring out what’s possible or too much of a stretch goal. Apart from this, Yuansi organized a survey to gauge what users want from an AR cooking app, and Tim revamped the website.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>By next week, we want to have a basic prototype set up with buttons that can cycle through basic instructions on a virtually mapped space. Xiao will start designing and implementing the backend instruction system and a basic interface. Travis will start with mapping the room structure. Tim will start looking into hand tracking, and will try to get gestures to be recognized. Once gestures are recognized we can use them instead of the handheld controller. Yuansi will design the 3D dashboard, as well as ideate 3D models and animations.</p>
                <h4>Blocking Issues</h4>
                <p>All of the blocking issues at this time come from the fact that we need to talk to Joerg about the feasibility of a couple of our features. We want to start looking into whether our stretch goals are actually achievable with the Magic Leap system. These include object tracking, content persistence and social media integration.</p>
