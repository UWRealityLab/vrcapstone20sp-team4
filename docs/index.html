                <p>An augmented reality cooking app that guides users through step-by-step instructions in Magic Leap.
                  We believe this application can provide users with an intuitive and enjoyable culinary experience.</p>
                <p>Cooking is supposed to be a fun process. However, many people struggle with constantly switching
                  between stovetops and digital recipes when learning to cook something new. The hassle can be
                  inconvenient and unsanitary. An Augmented Reality display is a perfect solution to this dilemma as
                  users can refer to a recipe while keeping the food tractable at the same time. Previous projects in AR
                  cooking are concepts of showing a 2D screen of recipe and instructions overlayed on top of the 3D
                  environment, but none of them has fully taken advantage of ML’s support on spatial mapping and image
                  tracking. The 2D interfaces are not as entertaining to interact with either. Also, some of them do
                  have good user interaction but are hardcoded and only works in a specific scene. With Magic Leap, we
                  believe we can create an application that users can easily use in their kitchen without complicated
                  setup, and that provides consistent information on time and location of food. We are also planning on
                  creating human-centered UI and delightful animation to make the cooking experience interactive and
                  amusing.</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week consisted of us getting acquainted with each other as well as figuring out how to set Unity
                  and the tutorials that we walked through. We also worked on brainstorming ideas for our projects. We
                  have come up with the very basic idea that we want to help people communicate with each other during
                  this time, however a deeper dive into actual ideas is needed. Each member of the group does similar
                  work this week.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>Get a stronger idea for what we want to make. We will be meeting up and having more brainstorming
                  sessions for getting a more solid idea down. Our goal is to get the website up and running by next
                  week as well as finalize the initial design of our application. In addition, we also want to do some
                  research about networking and creating a multiplayer game using Unity’s frameworks.</p>


                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week we tried to come up with ideas for our project. We want our experience to enable people to
                  come together during these times. When brainstorming ideas, we were drawn to making an intimate
                  experience for close friends or those in relationships. However there were a couple of issues with
                  this, including making an intimate experience in VR as well as the fact that many of our ideas are
                  already done outside of VR. During our lab time and presentation of our ideas with the staff, we
                  decided that there were too many experiences that let people interact with one another, and so we
                  switched our idea to a cooking AR project.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>We will iterate on our cooking idea, and will put together a pitch video for Tuesday as well as start
                  to narrow our ideas down to fill out the PRD. Everyone will be working on this to get a solid idea
                  down.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week consisted of finalizing our idea for our project. Coming off of the initial project idea
                  meeting from 4/9, we decided that we wanted to move in a different direction from a shared VR
                  experience to making an AR app to help with cooking. For the duration of this week, we came up with
                  more concrete ideas for these topics, and figured out specific deliverables. These meetings and
                  working on the PRD consisted of all group members pitching their ideas and figuring out what’s
                  possible or too much of a stretch goal. Apart from this, Yuansi organized a survey to gauge what users
                  want from an AR cooking app, and Tim revamped the website.</p>
                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>By next week, we want to have a basic prototype set up with buttons that can cycle through basic
                  instructions on a virtually mapped space. Xiao will start designing and implementing the backend
                  instruction system and a basic interface. Travis will start with mapping the room structure. Tim will
                  start looking into hand tracking, and will try to get gestures to be recognized. Once gestures are
                  recognized we can use them instead of the handheld controller. Yuansi will design the 3D dashboard, as
                  well as ideate 3D models and animations.</p>
                <h4>Blocking Issues</h4>
                <p>All of the blocking issues at this time come from the fact that we need to talk to Joerg about the
                  feasibility of a couple of our features. We want to start looking into whether our stretch goals are
                  actually achievable with the Magic Leap system. These include object tracking, content persistence and
                  social media integration.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>This week we started deploying the components that are the initial building blocks for our augmented
                  reality cooking application. Xiao started working on designing the backend system that includes
                  objects and classes such as ApplicationState that keeps track of all the information about the
                  application, Ingredients and Utensils for keeping track of information about the utensils in the
                  kitchen and ingredients used for the recipe. There’s also a main scheduler that manages the state of
                  the application and acts as a controller in a Model View Controller design. A Step class was also
                  added to represent a step in the cooking process. This class has a timer and list of ingredients and
                  utensils. Trung worked on a script that allows interactions with the AR objects using Magic Leap’s
                  hand tracking. Users are able to pick up and move 3d objects around. We also experimented with
                  raycasting with users’ fingers. We wrote a script that uses MLRaycast and MLHandTracking to cast a ray
                  from the user’s index finger. We thought that this would be very useful later on when we start
                  deploying user interfaces for our app. One option is to have the user able to interact with a distant
                  interface using their finger. For this week, Yuansi worked on the initial design of the application’s
                  interface as well as sketching out the 3D animations for our animated instructions. We also looked
                  into how to import animations from Maya into Unity. Travis worked on a script that can be used to scan
                  the physical objects and the room to collect meshing, using Magic Leap’s controller. This can be used
                  to define where in the environment can we place digital objects and our interfaces as well as mapping
                  the physical objects like utensils or a microwave.</p>

                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>In addition we talked about each specific step in our cooking recipe and what each step is supposed
                  to do. We also brainstormed on what 3D models and animations we need for each step.</p>
                <p>For the rest of this week and next week, we plan to start doing 3D animations so we can have a basic
                  cooking application where users can go through all the main cooking steps. This includes repeating a
                  previous step, skipping one step. We also want to deploy a basic user interface so that the user can
                  give instructions to the system.</p>

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <h4>What We Did</h4>
                <p>In this week, our work was mainly focusing on improving, debugging our backend program, and
                  initiating front end interface prototype. Xiao made updates on backend functions that allowed users to stop, start, or
                  restart a timer for a step. The purpose of these functions is to tolerate accidents users can potentially experience when
                  using our application. For example, if a user receives a phone call while cooking, the user should be able to
                  stop an ongoing process. In addition, since importing recipes are easier as we formalized it with deserialization, we
                  added more recipes into our system and made functions that helped users navigate through tutorials. Travis made a script
                  that periodically updates spatial information, given that we want spatial information but also want to save computing
                  power when it is not needed. Trung tried out rendering animation in a magic leap device. He also implemented basic controls
                  of animation with magic leap hand tracking including translation and rotation. Yuansi has worked on interface design.
                  She made a prototype of a hand menu that we are planning on including in our MVP.

                <h4>Plan For Next Week</h4>
                <p>Before presenting MVP:
                We need to make an onboarding interface that allows the user to select recipes, as well as previewing a selected recipe
                (ingredients, utensils needed) before confirming. At the minimum, we need to make a preliminary interface that connects users with backend functions.
                UI controls should be properly implemented with hand tracking.
                </p>
